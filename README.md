as I learn the basics of javascript I will create dumb projects like this one. 
This "project" is a counter which I created using javascript functions, the way it functions is very simple. I created a vast array of .onclick commands which initiate a 
function which is one of the three. Either count+=1;, count-=1; or count=o. The addition function will be for the increase button, the subtraction function will be for
the decrease button, and equals 0 is for the reset button, meaning the counter will reset to 0.
